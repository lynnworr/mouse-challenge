# mouse-challenge

The first observation that I noticed was the drug Capomulin and Ramicane were tested at more timepoints
than all of the other drugs. I'm not sure the significance of this, but the difference was noticable.

The next observation that was extracted from the data was that the average tumor volume was larger
when compared with the weight of the mouse. So, the larger the mouse the larger the size of tumor
the mouse had, when it came to the Capomulin drug tested mice. 

The final observation I had was that there was a noticable decrease in tumor size in mouse I509 from
day 20 to day 35. In fact, there was an 8 mm decrease in size during that time period of takinig the drug
Capomulin.
